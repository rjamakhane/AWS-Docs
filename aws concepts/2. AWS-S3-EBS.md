# 🟦 AWS Storage Concepts — S3 and EBS

---

## 🧩 AWS Service Naming Convention

- All AWS services **start with** and **end with** the word **Service**.  
  Examples:
  - **SNS → Simple Notification Service**
  - **SES → Simple Email Service**

---

## ☁️ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

### 🔹 Overview
- **S3 = Simple Storage Service**
- **Unlimited storage** provided by AWS.
- **Object-based storage** (stores data as objects, not blocks or files).
- Can store **any kind of file** — images, videos, documents, backups, etc.  
  *(Also called flat files)*

---

### 🔹 Key Features
- Upload, download, and access data from anywhere.
- **Cannot execute or run** files stored in S3.
- **Serverless** — AWS automatically handles:
  - **High Availability (HA)**
  - **Performance**
  - **Scalability**
- **Regional Service** — each **Bucket** exists within a specific AWS Region.

---

### 🔹 S3 Structure & Terminology

| Local Concept | S3 Equivalent | Description |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Laptop | S3 | Cloud storage space |
| Folder | Bucket | Container for objects |
| File | Object | Data file stored in a bucket |
| File Name | Key | Unique identifier for the object |

Example:  
`pushpa.mp4` → Object Name = Key

---

### 🔹 Buckets and Objects
- **Bucket** → A container for storing objects (files).
- **Object** → The actual file stored inside a bucket.
- **Key** → Unique name assigned to each object in a bucket.

---

### 🔹 Static Website Hosting on S3
- S3 supports **static website hosting**.
- **Steps:**
  1. Create a bucket.
  2. Upload HTML/CSS/JS files.
  3. Enable “Static Website Hosting” in the bucket properties.
- No need to configure HA, scalability, or performance — AWS manages it automatically.

### 🔹 Storage Comparison

| Device | Capacity |
|--------|-----------|
| Floppy Disk | 2 MB |
| CD | 700 MB |
| DVD | 4.7 GB |
| Pen Drive | 128 GB |
| Hard Disk | 2 TB |
| **S3** | **Unlimited** |

## 💽 Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

### 🔹 Overview
- **EBS = Elastic Block Storage**
- **Block-based storage** that acts like a virtual hard disk.
- Each disk (volume) is called an **EBS Volume**.
- Volumes can be **attached** or **detached** from EC2 instances.

---

### 🔹 EC2 and Volumes
- An **EC2 instance** has:
  - **1 Root Volume** (contains the OS)
  - **Multiple Additional Volumes** (for data)
- The **Root Volume** always contains an OS (e.g., Windows, Linux).
- EBS supports only **Server-Side OS** (not Client-Side).

---

### 🔹 OS and Device Names
| OS Type | Default Volume Name | Additional Volumes |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Windows/Linux | `/dev/sda1` | `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, `/dev/sdf`, etc. |

---

### 🔹 EBS Volume Characteristics
- **Max Size:** 16 TB per volume  
- **Pre-provisioned:** e.g., 50GB, 100GB, etc.  
- **Can increase** volume size on the fly (no downtime).  
- **Cannot decrease** volume size directly — must delete and recreate.
- **EBS is Regional** — Volumes exist within a specific **Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- **EC2 instance and volume must be in the same AZ.**

---

### 🔹 Volume Attachment Rules
- One EC2 instance can have multiple EBS volumes.
- **One volume cannot be attached to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.**
- You **can detach** an **additional** volume while the instance is running (not recommended).
- You **cannot detach** the **root** volume while the instance is running — must stop it first.
- Volumes cannot be shared among EC2 instances.

---

### 🔹 Example Scenarios

| Scenario | Possible? | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Attach 1a volume to 1b EC2 (different AZ) | ❌ | Must be in same AZ |
| Attach 1a volume to 1a EC2 (same AZ) | ✅ | Works fine |
| Share one volume among multiple EC2s | ❌ | Not supported by EBS |
| Increase volume size while running | ✅ | No downtime |
| Decrease volume size | ❌ | Must recreate volume |

---

### 🔹 Root vs Additional Volumes

| Type | Contains | Mount Point | Can Detach While Running? |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Root Volume | OS | `/dev/sda1` | ❌ Must stop instance first |
| Additional Volume | User Data | `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc. | ✅ Not recommended |

---

### 🧠 Summary: S3 vs EBS

| Feature | S3 | EBS |
|----------|----|-----|
| Type | Object Storage | Block Storage |
| Attach to EC2 | ❌ | ✅ |
| Execution | Not possible | Can run OS |
| Scalability | Unlimited | Up to 16 TB |
| AZ Dependency | Regional | Must be in same AZ |
| Access | Web/API | Attached to EC2 |
| Cost | Pay per GB stored | Pay per GB provisioned |
| Use Case | Backup, Static Website Hosting | OS, Application Data |

## 🎯 AWS Certification Q&A — S3 & EBS

### 🧰 Amazon S3

**1. What type of storage is S3 — Block, File, or Object?**  
👉 **Object-based storage.**

**2. What is a Bucket and an Object in S3?**  
👉 A **Bucket** is a container that holds **Objects (files)**. Each file is stored as an Object inside a Bucket.

**3. What is the difference between a Key and an Object?**  
👉 The **Object** is the actual file; the **Key** is the unique name identifying that file in the bucket.

**4. Can S3 execute stored files?**  
👉 ❌ No, S3 cannot execute or run any files. It’s used for storage only.

**5. Is S3 serverless?**  
👉 ✅ Yes. AWS manages servers, HA, performance, and scalability.

**6. Can S3 be used to host a website? If yes, what kind?**  
👉 ✅ Yes, it supports **static website hosting** (HTML/CSS/JS).

**7. Is S3 regional or global?**  
👉 **Regional.** Buckets are created in a specific AWS Region.

**8. Who manages scalability and HA for S3?**  
👉 AWS automatically manages both.

**9. What are common S3 use cases?**  
👉 Backup, media storage, data archiving, website hosting, and static content delivery.

### 💾 Amazon EBS

**1. What type of storage is EBS — Block, File, or Object?**  
👉 **Block-based storage.**

**2. What is the difference between Root Volume and Additional Volume?**  
👉 **Root Volume** contains the OS, while **Additional Volumes** store application or user data.

**3. Can you detach a Root Volume while EC2 is running?**  
👉 ❌ No. You must stop the EC2 instance first.

**4. Can a single EBS volume be attached to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously?**  
👉 ❌ No. A volume can only be attached to one EC2 at a time.

**5. What is the maximum EBS volume size?**  
👉 **16 TB per volume.**

**6. Can the volume size be increased on the fly?**  
👉 ✅ Yes, volume size can be increased without downtime.

**7. Can the volume size be decreased directly?**  
👉 ❌ No. You must recreate the volume.

**8. Must an EC2 instance and its volume be in the same Availability Zone?**  
👉 ✅ Yes, both must reside in the same AZ.

**9. Is EBS regional or global?**  
👉 **Regional.** Volumes exist within a specific AZ under a region.

**10. What are common use cases for EBS?**  
👉 OS boot volumes, databases, and application data storage.

---

### 🧠 Bonus Conceptual Question

> **Q:** You need shared storage that multiple EC2 instances can access simultaneously.  
> **Should you use EBS or EFS?**

👉 **Use EFS (Elastic File System)**, because EBS cannot be shared across instances, while EFS is designed for concurrent access by multiple EC2 instances.
