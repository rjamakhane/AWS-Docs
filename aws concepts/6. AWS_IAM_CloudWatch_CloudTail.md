## üß© Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Overview
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** enables secure access control for AWS resources.
- It defines **who** (users, roles) can access **what** (resources) and **how** (permissions and policies).

### Key Concepts
- **Root User**: Full administrative access; should not be used for daily tasks.
- **IAM Users**: Limited permissions; use groups and roles for access delegation.
- **IAM Roles**: Temporary credentials for AWS services or federated users.
- **Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions (allow/deny actions).
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Used in AWS Organizations to apply permission boundaries across accounts.

### Example Scenario
A company uses one **root account** and creates multiple **IAM users** with limited permissions for EC2, S3, and RDS.

### Key Exam Tips
- IAM is a **global service** (not region-specific).  
- Always enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for the root user.  
- Prefer **roles** over embedding credentials in applications.

### Sample Certification Questions
1. What is the **recommended best practice** for root account usage in AWS?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Avoid using the root account for daily tasks; enable MFA and use IAM users/roles.

2. How do **IAM policies** and **SCPs** differ in purpose and scope?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** IAM policies grant or restrict permissions for users/roles. SCPs restrict permissions across accounts in an Organization and cannot grant additional permissions.

3. Which IAM feature enables **temporary access credentials** for EC2 or Lambda?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** IAM Roles.

## üè¢ AWS Organizations

### Overview
- Used to **centrally manage multiple AWS accounts** for consolidated billing and governance.
- Enables applying **SCPs (Service Control Policies)** to enforce restrictions across member accounts.

### Structure
- **Management Account (Root Account)**: Controls the entire organization.  
- **Member Accounts**: Managed under the root for Dev, Test, or Support environments.

### Example Setup
- Root Account ‚Üí Member Accounts: DevOps, Developer, Testing, Support.  
- Each environment can have separate IAM users, services, and access levels.

### Key Exam Tips
- **Organizations** support **consolidated billing** and **policy enforcement**.  
- SCPs **cannot grant permissions**; they only **restrict** them.

### Sample Certification Questions
1. What is the role of the **management account** in AWS Organizations?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** It manages the organization, applies SCPs, and handles consolidated billing.

2. Can **SCPs** override permissions set in an IAM policy?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Yes, SCPs can restrict permissions, even if an IAM policy grants them.

3. How does **consolidated billing** reduce overall AWS costs?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Combines usage from all accounts for volume discounts and cost optimization.

- **Detailed Monitoring**: 1-minute intervals (billable).

### Key Exam Tips
- Use **CloudWatch Alarms + SNS** for automated alerting.  
- CloudWatch can monitor **both AWS and custom metrics**.  
- Logs can be integrated with **Lambda or Kinesis** for analysis.

### Sample Certification Questions
1. What‚Äôs the difference between **Basic** and **Detailed** monitoring in CloudWatch?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Basic = 5-min interval (free), Detailed = 1-min interval (billed).

2. How can you **automatically trigger actions** (like rebooting an instance) from a CloudWatch alarm?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Use CloudWatch Alarms with **SNS + Lambda** or EC2 actions.

3. Which AWS service integrates with CloudWatch for **log storage and querying**?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** CloudWatch Logs.

## üìú CloudTrail

### Overview
- **AWS CloudTrail** monitors and records **API calls** made in an AWS account.  
- Used for **auditing, compliance, and security investigation**.

### Key Exam Tips
- CloudTrail is **enabled per region** but can be **aggregated into one S3 bucket**.  
- It records **who did what, when, and from where**.  
- CloudTrail + CloudWatch = powerful monitoring combo.

### Sample Certification Questions
1. How does **CloudTrail differ from CloudWatch**?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** CloudTrail logs API calls/events for auditing; CloudWatch monitors metrics and system performance.

2. Where are **CloudTrail logs** stored by default?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Amazon S3 buckets.

3. Which AWS services integrate with CloudTrail for **security analytics**?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Config, Security Hub.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è AWS Config

### Overview
- **AWS Config** tracks configuration changes of AWS resources.  
- Useful for **compliance auditing** and **security governance**.

### Key Exam Tips
- Config can trigger **SNS notifications** or **Lambda functions** when resources change.  
- Works closely with **CloudTrail** for auditing.

### Sample Certification Questions
1. What is the purpose of **AWS Config Rules**?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Evaluate resource configurations for compliance against desired settings.

2. How can you use Config for **resource compliance monitoring**?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Set rules and trigger notifications when resources drift from compliance.

3. Can AWS Config automatically **remediate non-compliant resources**?  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Yes, via **Config rules with automatic remediation actions**.
