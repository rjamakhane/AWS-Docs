# IAM & AWS Access – Deep Dive  
*Based on your lecture notes, improved and expanded for clarity*

## 1. Introduction to IAM (Identity and Access Management)  
- IAM is **global** (applies across regions for an AWS account).  
- IAM is **free** (there is no extra cost to create/manage IAM users, groups, roles)  
- Purpose: Centralised control of access to AWS resources via permissions.

## 2. Accounts & Users  
### 2.1 Root Account  
- The **Root User** is the AWS account owner (email + password) — has full privileges by default.  
- Best practice: **Do not** use the Root account for everyday work. Use it only for essential account-level tasks (billing, account closure, etc.).  
- Enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** on the root account.  
- Do not share the root account credentials.

### 2.2 IAM Users  
- IAM Users: individual identities created under the AWS account. They can be assigned defined permissions (via policies).  
- For everyday activities (console login, API access), use IAM users instead of the root user.  
- Enable MFA for every IAM user where possible.  
- Do not share users / credentials / passwords among multiple people.

### 2.3 Access methods  
There are two primary ways to access AWS as an IAM user:  
- **Console Access** (GUI): via a web browser. Log in with email/username + password + (optionally) MFA.  
- **Programmatic Access**: via CLI, SDKs, APIs. Authentication uses an **Access Key** (Access Key ID + Secret Access Key).  
  - The secret key is visible only once at creation. If lost, you must create a new key. You cannot recover the old one.  
  - It’s not recommended to create/use the root account’s access keys for programmatic access.  
  - Best practice: each IAM user has up to **2** sets of access keys (one active, one inactive or rotated).  
  - Rotate access keys and passwords periodically.

## 3. Permissions & Policies  
- Permissions in AWS are granted via **Policies**. A policy describes *what* actions are allowed/denied, *on which* resources, *under what conditions*.  
- Attach policies to IAM users, groups, or roles.  
- Principle of **least privilege**: grant only the permissions needed to perform the job.

## 4. Recommended IAM Best Practices  
- Enable MFA for root account and for IAM users with elevated privileges.  
- Avoid using root credentials for normal tasks.  
- Limit long-lived credentials. Use roles when possible (e.g., for EC2, Lambda).  
- Regularly rotate passwords, access keys.  
- Create IAM users instead of sharing a common user/account.  
- Monitor and audit IAM activity (AWS CloudTrail, IAM Access Advisor).  
- Use groups for common permission sets instead of granting permissions to each user individually.  
- Use roles for temporary permissions, cross-account access, service-to-service access.  

## 5. Example IAM Users & Permissions (Illustrative)  
- User Sunil → Permitted to manage EC2.  
- User Pavani → Permitted for S3, IAM.  
- User Aman → Permitted for RDS, EFS.  
- User Suresh → Permitted for Route 53.  
- User Sudhakar → Admin permissions (except billing).  
  - These are just example names to illustrate role-based access.

## 6. Two Ways to Access AWS  
### 6.1 Console Access (GUI)  
- Entry via login page: email/username + password + (MFA) → AWS console.  
- IAM user or root user can log in (depending on permissions).  
### 6.2 Programmatic Access (CLI / SDKs / APIs)  
- Install AWS CLI on Windows / Linux (or use SDKs for Java/.NET/Python).  
- Use `aws configure` (for CLI) to input Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, default output format.  
- Keys provide full access (depending on the IAM policy) just like console access — so treat them securely.  
- Don’t create unnecessary keys; rotate them; disable inactive keys.

# Practice Questions for AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)  
*(Note: These are practice items based on publicly available resources, used for revision & learning only.)*  

| Q # | Question | Answer | Explanation |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | A company runs a public-facing three-tier web application in a VPC across multiple Availability Zones. EC2 instances for the application tier run in private subnets and need to download software patches from the internet, yet they should not be directly accessible from the internet. Which actions should be taken? (Choose TWO) | A) Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet. **&** B) Define a custom route table with a route to the NAT gateway for internet traffic and associate it with the private subnets. 1 | Instances in private subnets cannot access the internet directly. A NAT gateway in a public subnet allows outbound internet access for private-subnet resources. The private subnets’ route tables must direct traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT gateway. |
| 2 | A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is heavily used during office hours (9am-5pm). Users complain the application is slow at the start of the day but then works normally. What is the **most operationally efficient** solution? | Configure a **Scheduled scaling policy** for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances **before** the start of the day. 2 | Since the load is predictable (office hours), it’s best to schedule scaling ahead of time rather than wait for metrics to spike and then react. |
| 3 | A company plans to migrate a persistent database from on-premises to an EC2 instance in AWS. The database requires 64,000 IOPS and, if possible, should be stored on a **single** Amazon EBS volume. What should you recommend? | Create a Nitro-based EC2 instance with an Amazon EBS **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/ io2)** volume and provision ~64,000 IOPS. 3 | To achieve very high IOPS, you use io1/io2 volumes with high IOPS provision. Instance store or striping many volumes isn't as optimal for a single‐volume requirement. |
