# üöÄ AWS Services Deep Dive: Compute, Networking & Serverless

---

## I. AWS Service Scopes

AWS services are categorized into **Regional** or **Global** based on their scope.

- **Regional Service Example:**
  - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a **Regional service**.
    - An EC2 instance is tied to a **specific AWS Region** and an **Availability Zone (AZ)** within that region.

---

## II. AWS Compute Services

### 1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) ‚Äì *The Virtual Server*

- **Core Function:**  
  Launch and run virtual servers, known as **EC2 instances**, in the AWS Cloud.

- **Also Known As:**  
  Servers / Instances / Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **Your Responsibilities (IaaS Model):**
  - OS installation and updates
  - Application configuration and deployment
  - Security patching and scaling
  - Managing EC2 lifecycle (start/stop/reboot/terminate)

---

### 2. Elastic Beanstalk ‚Äì *Application Deployment Platform (PaaS)*

- **Purpose:**  
  Simplifies application deployment by abstracting the underlying infrastructure.

- **Service Model:**  
  **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

#### üß† Key Characteristics:

| Feature                | Elastic Beanstalk (AWS)                         | Traditional PaaS                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| EC2 Access             | ‚úÖ Full control of underlying EC2 instances     | ‚ùå No access to underlying servers          |
| Deployment Simplicity  | ‚úÖ Upload & go (e.g., .zip, Java, Docker, etc.) | ‚úÖ Managed environments                    |
| Flexibility            | ‚úÖ Customize EC2, scaling, and networking       | ‚ùå Limited infrastructure flexibility       |

- **Backbone:**  
  Under the hood, Beanstalk uses **EC2 instances** along with other AWS resources.

- **Workflow Overview:**
  1. Upload application code.
  2. Choose a runtime environment (e.g., Tomcat, .NET, Docker).
  3. Beanstalk automatically provisions and manages:
     - EC2 instances
     - Load Balancers
     - Auto-Scaling
     - Health monitoring

---

### 3. Lightsail ‚Äì *Simplified Virtual Servers*

- **Purpose:**  
  Easy and quick way to launch simple applications or websites.

- **Pre-configured Applications:**  
  Includes tools and platforms such as:
  - WordPress, GitLab, Node.js
  - Joomla, Drupal, Redmine
  - Nginx, CPanel

- **Best Use Case:**  
  Small web apps, proof of concepts, static sites.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

- ‚ùå No **Auto-Scaling**
- ‚ùå No **High Availability**
- ‚ùå No built-in **Scalability** (manual only)
- Suitable for simpler workloads; not ideal for production-scale apps.

---

### 4. AWS Lambda ‚Äì *Serverless Compute*

- **Purpose:**  
  Run backend code without provisioning or managing servers.

- **Core Principle:**  
  **Serverless** ‚Äî no infrastructure management required. AWS handles:
  - Scaling
  - Fault tolerance
  - Availability

- **Function Model:**
  - You write small units of code called **Lambda Functions**.
  - Supported languages: Python, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby, etc.

---

#### üîÑ Event-Driven Architecture

- Lambda functions are invoked based on **events or triggers**.
- Example events:
  - EC2 instance state changes
  - Scheduled time (via CloudWatch or EventBridge)
  - S3 object creation
  - API Gateway requests

#### üß© Example Workflow:

| Time       | Event Trigger         | Lambda Function | Action                          |
|------------|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 9:00 PM    | Schedule               | STOPFn           | Stops all EC2 instances          |
| 6:00 AM    | Schedule               | STARTFn          | Starts all EC2 instances         |
| EC2 Launch | Instance State Change  | EC2TerminatorFn  | Terminates specific EC2 instance|

#### üîó EventBridge + Lambda

- **EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)** lets you:
  - Define **rules** (e.g., schedule, pattern match)
  - Route events to **targets**, such as Lambda functions

##### Visual Model:
```text
[ Event Source ]
       ‚Üì
[ Event Rule (EventBridge) ]
       ‚Üì
[ Lambda Function ]
       ‚Üì
[ Executes Action (e.g., Stop EC2) ]
```
