# Client-Server Architecture and Its Tiers Explained üñ•Ô∏è

**Client-Server architecture** is a foundational computing model where workloads are distributed between a **client** (the requester) and a **server** (the provider).

---

## Core Components: Client vs. Server

| **Component** | **Role**                                              | **Analogy**                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Client**    | Requests a service; handles the user interface (Presentation). | The customer at a restaurant.     |
| **Server**    | Provides the service; processes requests and manages resources (data). | The kitchen/chef preparing the meal. |

## The Three Logical Functions (Job Separation)

Modern systems separate the workload into three **logical functions**, regardless of how the system is physically set up:

- **Presentation**:  
  The user interface (what the user sees and interacts with).

- **Application (Business Logic)**:  
  The rules, processes, and execution steps (e.g., calculating sales tax, verifying login credentials).

- **Data**:  
  The storage and retrieval of information (the database).

## Types of Architecture by Tiers

‚Äú**Tiers**‚Äù refer to how these three logical functions are physically separated onto different machines or server groups.

---

### 1. 1-Tier Architecture (Single Tier)

- **Definition**:  
  All three functions (Presentation, Application, and Data) reside on a **single device**.

- **Example**:  
  A local calculator app or a single-user desktop application that stores files locally.

- **Note**:  
  Often called a "**standalone**" application; **not a true client-server model**.

---

### 2. 2-Tier Architecture (Two-Tier)

- **Separation**:  
  Splits the system into **two physical parts**:

  - **Tier 1 (Client)**:  
    Handles **Presentation** and most **Application Logic**.
  
  - **Tier 2 (Server)**:  
    Handles all **Data storage** (Database Server).

- **Drawback**:  
  Limited scalability ‚Äî the **Server (Tier 2)** can become overloaded by handling both data storage and many simultaneous client requests.

---

### 3. 3-Tier Architecture (Three-Tier)

- **Separation**:  
  Clearly separates the three functions onto distinct tiers/servers.  
  This is the **industry standard** for modern **web and enterprise applications** (e.g., those hosted on **AWS** or **Azure**).

- **Tiers**:

  - **Tier 1: Presentation Tier**  
    Client/Browser interface

  - **Tier 2: Application Tier**  
    Application Server / Business Logic

  - **Tier 3: Data Tier**  
    Database Server

- **Advantage**:  
  **High scalability and maintainability**. Each tier can be independently scaled, secured, or updated.

## Summary Table: Tiers at a Glance

| **Tier** | **Presentation** | **Application Logic** | **Data**           | **Example**                         |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1-Tier   | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ                      | ‚úÖ                   | Local text editor                   |
| 2-Tier   | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ (mostly)             | ‚ùå (on separate DB)  | Desktop app connected to SQL Server|
| 3-Tier   | ‚úÖ (Browser)      | ‚úÖ (App Server)         | ‚úÖ (Database Server) | Web apps like Amazon, Facebook      |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Understanding client-server architecture and its tiered structure is essential for designing scalable and efficient systems. As systems grow in complexity, **moving from 1-tier to 3-tier** (or even **n-tier**) allows for better performance, scalability, and maintainability.
